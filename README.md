# csml-reading-group

Repository for notes and code associated with computational statistics and machine learning reading group at 
[University College London Advanced Research Computing Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/advanced-research-computing-centre).

Meeting schedule is in the [wiki](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/csml-reading-group/wiki).

For each book chapter covered the plan is to create code to recreate the figures in that chapter. 
Code examples should be organized by book and language as in the following example directory tree 

```
probabilistic-machine-learning-an-introduction
├── julia
└── r
```

and the filename should be prefixed by the zero-padded chapter and figure numbers separated by underscores, for example

```
01_02_description_of_figure.ext
```

for a file which recreates Figure 2 from Chapter 1.

To indicate you plan to work on a figure for a particular chapter [create an issue](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/csml-reading-group/issues/new/choose)
(if a relevant one does not already exist) and assign it to yourself. Once you have started working on the figure open a pull request and link to
the issue.
